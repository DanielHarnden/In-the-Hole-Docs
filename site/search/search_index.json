Different combinations of icons provide different payouts , and can provide money or items . Default Icons The slot machine starts with 7 icons: Icon List Icon Category Rarity Cherry Fruit Common Grapes Fruit Uncommon Icon Rarity Each icon has a rarity value defined in its metadata, represented as an integer. This integer maps to a named rarity (e.g., Common, Uncommon, etc.) for ease of communication. Additionally, each rarity is assigned a commonality value that determines how likely it is to appear in the slot machine. Items can alter an item's commonality. When the reels are reset, a weighted reel pool is built based on these commonality values. For example, if Common has a commonality of 5 and Rare has a commonality of 1, the chance of selecting a Common icon is 5/6, while Rare has a 1/6 chance. Rarity Variable Rarity Name Rarity Commonality 1 Common 2 Uncommon 3 Rare 4 Legendary Developer Information Icons are imported from .json files located in the res://Data/Icons folder.
